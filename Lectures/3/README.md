# Lambda Academy 2015.01 - Swift
## Lecture 3 - Extending Voter App

We're going to extend an existing Voter App with a couple of new features.

#### Plan of action
- choose one of the issues listed [here](https://github.com/lambdaacademy/2015.01_swift/issues)
- add a description so other people know you started working on this task
- start implementing feature
- ask teacher if you need technical support
- when feature is done push all your commits to Github and send a pull request
- go back to pt. 1
